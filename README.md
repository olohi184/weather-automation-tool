# 🌦️ Weather Automation Tool

This repository contains my **Weather Automation Tool Project**, built step by step to learn Python, automation, and APIs.  

The tool starts as a **basic CLI program with dummy weather data** (V1), and will later evolve into a real-time weather app powered by APIs.

## 🚀 Features (V1 - Basic CLI)
- Simple **command line interface (CLI)**.
- User enters a city name.
- Returns a **dummy weather report** with:
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Weather condition
- Handles unknown cities with a default response.
